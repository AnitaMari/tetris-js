I did this project following this tutorial: "¡Resuelvo la PRUEBA TÉCNICA del TETRIS con JAVASCRIPT en menos de 40 minutos! by midudev, a web developer who creates content for people who are learning. This is the link: https://youtu.be/pNiyz0sl1no?si=_zqpEuH2hz0-Ie5b.



## Tech Stack

This is a front-end project in which I used **Vanilla JavaScript** on the client side.


## Installation

To create this project, I run the command "npm create vite@latest" in the terminal (using git bash). I selected Vanilla and JavaScript.

Then, in the directory folder (cd tetris-js), I ran "npm install" to install the dependencies I needed. I also ran "npm install standard -D" to install a linter. In the package.json I added this:
                "eslintConfig": {
                    "extends": [
                        "standard"
                    ]
                }

Next, you have to run the command "npm run dev" to initialize the project in the browser. (You have to do ctrl+click on the port shown in the terminal to follow the link to run it locally).


## Demo

This is the video of the project:
